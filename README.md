# Elevator

Design an elevator system for a building

* It has 3 elevators
* Each floor has an up and down button for each elevator.
* A user can choose to press the up or down button for any elevator
on any floor.
* The elevator should come to that floor and its door
should open if it is moving in the same direction as the user.
* A user once in the elevator can press the button corresponding to
the floor he or she intends to go to. The elevator should go to the
desired floor and its doors should open.
